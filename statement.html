  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    
    <p>Life is always hard whenever I think of it. It is the same as thinking of being an artist in the future. What am I going to focus in term of art? Am I able to have a stable income from becoming an artist? What are the obstacles during the process of becoming an artist? All these factors feared me since the first year of college. I was focusing on learning what graphic design really is. However, the only thing I wished to know is “am I able to make money out of it?” I did not care about what art really is and disgusted from the art history classes. I kept sharping on skill on using adobe products and accomplished some portfolio level projects. But still, the answer I ever desired never came at me and all I had was piles of meaningless blank posters and wasted eleven times seventeen papers. It was not fun at all. But what happened if I make it fun and more enjoyable for everyone to see what I did? After a couple years of hard work and transferred to SJSU, I learned to enjoy making art instead of thinking about making money, and not worry about projecting my work to people. Basically just be optimistic rather than pessimistic</p>
