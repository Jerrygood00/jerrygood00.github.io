    <p>My name is Yun Che Hsieh. Life is always hard whenever I think of it. It is the same as thinking of being an artist in the future. What am I going to focus on the term of art? Am I able to have a stable income from becoming an artist? What are the obstacles during the process of becoming an artist? All these factors feared me since the first year of community college. I was focusing on learning what graphic design really is. However, the only thing I wished to know is “am I able to make money out of it?” I did not care about what art really is. Instead, I kept sharping on skill in utilizing Adobe products and accomplished some portfolio level art projects. But still, the answer I ever desired never came at me and all I had was piles of meaningless blank posters and wasted eleven times seventeen papers.</p>

    <p>Personally, doing all those infinite printing, constantly picking on extremely small details and most importantly I could not examine the beauty behind typefaces. On my second thought, what happened if I tried to make projects I like more enjoyable for everyone to see? After a couple of years of hard work and transferred to SJSU, I learned to enjoy making art instead of thinking about making money, and not worry about projecting my work to people. Basically, trying to be optimistic rather than pessimistic.</p>

        <p>What am I doing anyway?</p>
