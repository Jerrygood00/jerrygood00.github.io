      <h4>Artist Statement</h4>
      <br>
      <p>My name is Yun Che Hsieh. Life is always hard whenever I think of it. It is the same as thinking of being an artist in the future. What am I going to focus in term of art? Am I able to have a stable income from becoming an artist? What are the obstacles during the process of becoming an artist? All these factors feared me since the first year of community college. I was focusing on learning what graphic design really is. However, the only thing I wished to know is “am I able to make money out of it?” I did not care about what art really is and felt disgusted from learning art history. Instead, I kept sharping on skill on utilizing Adobe products and accomplished some portfolio level art projects. But still, the answer I ever desired never came at me and all I had was piles of meaningless blank posters and wasted eleven times seventeen papers.</p>
      <br>
          <p>Personally, doing all those infinite printing, constantly picking on extremely small details and most importantly I could not examine the beauty behind typefaces. On my second thought, what happened if I tried make projects I like more enjoyable for everyone to see? After a couple years of hard work and transferred to SJSU, I learned to enjoy making art instead of thinking about making money, and not worry about projecting my work to people. Basically just be optimistic rather than pessimistic.</p>
    
      <h4><em>Clock</em>, p5 JavaScript, 2018</h4>
   
      <a href="art101_sk_template_p1/p5_root/sk1/index.html"><img src="art101_sk_template_p1/images/project%202a.png" alt="clock" width="500" height="auto"> </a>
    
      <p>Every second passed, the ellipse will change position, and every minute passed, the ellipse will move to the top right corner and move back from the bottom left corner. Ellipse on minute will change after passed sixty seconds as well. The purpose of this clock is not to tell what the actual time is but to show what an artistic clock can be accomplished through <a href="art101_sk_template_p1/p5_root/sk1/sketch.js"> coding</a>.</p>
   
      <h4><em>Labor</em>, Photoshop AfterEffect, 2018</h4>

      <p>Looking back at the time where people used to work in such long period of time with harsh condition and extreme caution to earn a small amount of income to survive a week. Compared to today's society where people among themselves have laws and other protections behind their back is rather interesting to observe.</p>
     
      <h4><em>Adrenaline Racer</em>, p5 JavaScript Photoshop, 2018</h4>
      
      <a href="art101_sk_template_p1/project3/project_3/index.html"><img src="art101_sk_template_p1/images/driftbattle2.png" alt="clock" width="600" height="auto"> </a>

      <p>This <a href="art101_sk_template_p1/project3/project_3/sketch.js">game</a> that I and one of my classmate named Wilson are working on is called Adrenaline Racer. The purpose of this game we worked on which to get the players to acknowledge the facts about drunk driving and wreckless driving, so they realized the consequences of these actions. This game can be educational and fun at the same time.</p>

      <p>Everytime I went back to my house at night, the hallway is always dark and cold. The sense of emptyness flows around where I was standing and starting to feel a chill behind my back. In this project, I was inspired by one of the horror games called "P.T." created by Hideo Kojima. I wanted to stage out the experience I had by making a video out of Maya and edited it through AfterEffect.</p>
     
      <h4><em>The Maze</em>, Fusion 360 3D Printer, 2018</h4>

      <iframe width="700" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmjDH_m0PAI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>For this project, I'm building upon the idea of labyrinth from Ancient Greek mythology. By playing around with Fusion 360 while exploring new tool to utilise at the same time, this 3D object is able to be build with multiple routes in a scaled cylinder and able to 3d print the object out to life using gcode exported from Cura. User is able to choose up to four difficulties by throwing a ball into the holes of laser cut plate and control its balance and move towards the end goal of the maze.</p>
      <h4><em>Cat Game</em>, Unity Photoshop, 2018</h4>
      <a href="https://yngame23.itch.io/catio"><img src="DkpgRA.png" width="600" height="auto"></a>
    
      <p>A lazy Cat is about to have his first date with Kiki the Rabbit. You have to help him pass his messy room to go outside and meet Kiki. Be careful, your key control is in reverse.</p>
