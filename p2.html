    <p>My project will be a small demo game for two players to interact with called Hunger. There will be multiple 2D vector arts staged as characters and obstacles to make players feel like they are in the game itself. The camera of the game will be moving up contently through time and players have to jump to the top in the effort to survive what is coming below them. The technical aspects that I require to have are smooth character movement mechanics and coding for obstacle interaction for the gameplays.</p>

    <h4><em>Description</em></h4>
    
    <p>Everyone feels hungry on a daily basis. Even if not immediately, they can count on having a meal within hours. They are the ones who suffer the hunger and do not have the option of eating when they are hungry. Both of animals do not get enough calories or essential nutrients to survive another day. They are the ones who are hungry have an ongoing problem with getting food to eat. They have a primary need to feed themselves and their children today and tomorrow. Come and gather as much food as you can and climb to the top of the heaven to receive the precious reward...</p>
<br>
    <p>Anyways...</p>
<br>
<p>Jump as fast as you can!</p>
