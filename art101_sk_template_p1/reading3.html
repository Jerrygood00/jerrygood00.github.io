		<p>
<b>Q1. Based on the Manovich reading, Find images of 2 examples of technologies that embodies for you the authors idea of how interfaces to early electronics were designed in the past. Specifically look for examples from 1950's,60's, and 70's, (..not 1980's and 90's...). Explain why these are good examples. Then list 2 more images of examples of technology that embody the authors ideas of how interfaces are today. Again, explain why these are good examples. Please include images and text description for each example you are refering to. 4 images minimum. Publish these images on your readings website.</b><br>

<h5> Tape Recorder</h5>
<p>
An audio tape recorder, tape deck or tape machine is an analog audio storage device that records and plays back sounds, including articulated voices, usually using magnetic tape, either wound on a reel or in a cassette, for storage. In its present-day form, it records a fluctuating signal by moving the tape across a tape head that polarizes the magnetic domains in the tape in proportion to the audio signal. Tape-recording devices include reel-to-reel tape deck and the cassette deck. <br>

<h5>Typewriter</h5>
<p>
A typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for writing characters similar to those produced by printer's movable type. Typically, a typewriter has an array of keys, each of which causes a different single character to be produced on the paper by causing an inked ribbon to be struck against the paper by a type element similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing.<br>

<b>Q2. From the Manovich reading, give 2 examples of interface or interactions with a piece of technology that has a performative action or theatrical behavior. This is in context with the ideas of credited to Brenda Laurel he mentions in the article. Explain why these are good examples.</b><br>
A rhythm game called “osu!” is played by clicking the various notes that pop up from the song you are playing. It accepts input electronics from keyboard, mouse, and tablet. There are expert song tracks that require much higher levels of reflexes to beat. The reaction speed and good listening skill is extemely required to play this game because of fast tracks of song makes everyone cry and rage for failling to play the song.
<br>
A game called Time Crisis is originated and published by SEGA who is the best video game company back in 90s. The objective in this game is to coop and work together to shoot through your way from the enemeies to the end. It is played with a “light gun” and a pedal that allows the player to take cover. Some models are a bit more advanced and have a small button on the magazine to have the players reload. The players must also physically move and aim the gun-shaped controllers to shoot the enemies.


<br>
<b>Q3. From the RadioLab Podcast, the guest podcast artist is sharing his radio show called 99% invisible. The first piece is about sound design. What would you describe the role of the sound designer and how does it relate to this idea of theatre and performance?</b><br>
The role of the sound designer relates to performance and theatrical because many time when we turn on our devices, the very first interaction we have with the device is sound. Much like starting a theater show by opening the stage curtains or even walking into a room with people you know, the greeting sound that your phone, computer or car makes when the device is turned on is letting you know to get ready for human and device interaction.


<br>
<b>Q4. Please come up with 2 piece of technology that normally don't have this interface design or 'consideration' mentioned in the reading and podcast, and that could benefit from this theatrifaction or gamification idea of interface.
What would you suggest doing to it? </b><br>
The keyboard should have created a better pressing sound rather than have a keyboard that has either no sound at all and a tiny sound I could not even hear.
<br>
Another example would be the GPS system imported onto automoblie today. It guides people to the right direction where their destination is. Even though, sometime the system could not recognize the new road that is built into whatever place it would be, and that is where the update of the map comes in. It kept renewing so that people are able to do what they wanted instead of heating up their head to figure out where is the right direction to go.
