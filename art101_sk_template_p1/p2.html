		<p>
		In this sketch, I also had difficult time trying to make it work normally since if and else command was confusing to me. The mouse follows the image, so as the rectangle. All rectangle changes color by moving the mouse cursor. If I press b, there will be a image and a rectangle show up in random color. I tried some new thing with importing gif in the sketch, but it did not move as the gif did. And it somehow moved in website. Thats weird I guess.

		<p>
		For sketch two, I used my past sketch two from project one and tried to make the ellipses changing itself by continuous trigonometry function. The difficult part I had is making the "second" preview more visable because of "minute" preview was too massive that blocked what is behind. Maybe I should have arranged the order the code so that the "second" preview is more popped out since it has the most interection in this sketch. Another difficult part was figuring out how the trigonometry works in coding. It sort of changed how the size of ellipse randomly by its own. I kind of wanted to know what make this happening. In this sketch, every second passed, the ellipse will change position, and every minute passed, the ellipse will move to the top right corner and move back from the bottom left corner. Ellipse on minute will change after passed sixty seconds as well.

		<p>
      In this sketch, I placed some pixel images from the first generation of pokemons. I was confused from adding another number to the 30x30 board and I somehow figured it out and begen working on it. I looked up the color value from photoshop and placed them into the numbers so that the board display it. It was pretty time-consuming overall because of the position of the pixel is a little bit difficult to look for. After three hours of work, I checked if the color value is what I wanted and no problem. It came out what I expected and able to run it on website as well.

   In this sketch, I managed to add position and size from json file and then imported to the sketch. The difficult part of this sketch was analyze how json file affect to the sketch. I thought it was only a data file that adjust the script code from lib folder and it is not. This json only applies to the sketch if I put loadJSON on function preload and it helped changed the form of the ellipse by typing jsonfilename.position and size. It seemed complicated at first since it is long and confusing. But after I tried to look into it a bit longer, it is actually not that confusing to understand.

For project 2b, I imported the sketch two from project one and create flashing rectangle in circles. It was very difficult to understand how the api work in the sketch. At least I did some couple tries and somehow got it working normally and add a search option so that I do not only show specify one or two cities. It is able to show every cities in the weather data api from openweathermap.org. I did not have trouble running the correct api key for the openweathermap website after seeing the email from Steve. I was confused about how the display the numbers from the api and got it working through the specify coding in the sketch.
