<h1> Sketch 1 </h1>

<p> In this sketch, I placed some pixel images from the first generation of pokemons. I was confused from adding another number to the 30x30 board and I somehow figured it out and begen working on it. I looked up the color value from photoshop and placed them into the numbers so that the board display it. It was pretty time-consuming overall because of the position of the pixel is a little bit difficult to look for. After three hours of work, I checked if the color value is what I wanted and no problem. It came out what I expected and able to run it on website as well.</p>
