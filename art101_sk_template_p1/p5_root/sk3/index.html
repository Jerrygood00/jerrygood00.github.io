<h1> Sketch 2 </h1>

<p> For sketch two, I used my past sketch two from project one and tried to make the ellipses changing itself by continuous trigonometry function. The difficult part I had is making the "second" preview more visable because of "minute" preview was too massive that blocked what is behind. Maybe I should have arranged the order the code so that the "second" preview is more popped out since it has the most interection in this sketch. Another difficult part was figuring out how the trigonometry works in coding. It sort of changed how the size of ellipse randomly by its own. I kind of wanted to know what make this happening. In this sketch, every second passed, the ellipse will change position, and every minute passed, the ellipse will move to the top right corner and move back from the bottom left corner. Ellipse on minute will change after passed sixty seconds as well. </p>
