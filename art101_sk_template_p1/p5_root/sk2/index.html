<h1> Sketch 1 </h1>

<p> In this sketch, I also had difficult time trying to make it work normally since if and else command was confusing to me. The mouse follows the image, so as the rectangle. All rectangle changes color by moving the mouse cursor. If I press b, there will be a image and a rectangle show up in random color. I tried some new thing with importing gif in the sketch, but it did not move as the gif did. And it somehow moved in website. Thats weird I guess.  </p>
