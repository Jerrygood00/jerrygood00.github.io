<h1> Adrenaline Racer </h1>

<p style="font-size:14px;">The purpose of this game we worked on which to get the players to acknowledge the facts about drunk driving and wreckless driving, so they realized the consequences of these actions. This game is educational and it can be fun at the same time. For the controls, cop car is J to drift left, I to move forward, and L to drift left. And for the race car is A to drift left, W to move forward, and D to drift right. There is also two silders that controls volume and a reset button to reload the page if players wanted to play again.</p>

<p style="font-size:11px;"> Car volume </p>
