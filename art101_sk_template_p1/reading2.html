         <h5>Questions</h5>
		<p>
		Q1. Given the Wikipedia definitions on data and information, what is your own take on this and specifically what is the difference between data and information?<br>
		Information is any entity or form that resolves uncertainty or provides the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. Data is collected and analyzed and put into graph or any other analysis tool.<br>
		Q2. From the Manovich reading, what is the difference between visualization and mapping?<br> “Visualization for the situations when quantified data which by itself is not visual – the output of meteorological sensors, stock market behaviors, the set of addresses describing the trajectory of a message through a computer network, and so on – is transformed into a visual representation. Explaining thing from visual.”<br>
            “The concept of mapping is closely related to visualization but it makes sense to keep it separate. By representing all data using the same numerical code, computers make it easy to map one representation into another: grayscale image into 3D surface, a sound wave into an image.”
            <br>
		Q3. When Manovich states that visualization is the anti-sublime art what is he referring to? Do you agree with this notion?<br>
		“The desire to take what is normally falls outside of the scale of human senses and to make visible and manageable aligns data visualization art with modern science.  I agree with the notion he mentioned of how scale of human senses interact the result of data and visualization art with modern science. It makes sense when human senses something the calculation changes. So it is not what individual’s perfection.”<br>
		Q4. When Manovich remarks on the 'dark-side' of mapping, what is he referring to?<br>
        He is referring to mappings that are represented or given data from infinite computer rendering causes graphic to appear.

                 Summary:<br>
                 Lauren Frick is a data artist, she uses data to explore more and experiments on with self-tracking. One of her the artworks she created was she  used data from Zeo, a an EEG sensor that measures how well you sleep. The results she got formed a pattern and noticed she doesn’t get much deep sleep but mostly have ainly has busy sleeps and is awake a lot. This was a hidden part of her, something she hasn’t seen about herself. She created a rule system with colors like red represents deep sleep, while yellow is REM sleep. She put this work into an art show and got noticed by the head of Zeo Inc., asking what he can do to help . so Frick asked for more data so she got data from the workers of Zeo so she compare her records with those. The color purple represents deep sleep, orange color represents waking up, the fingerprint results that male workers at the age 46 don’t get a lot of deep sleep while females at age 26 gets more deep sleep than males at around the same age. She believes that data tracking is to understand some part of us that we didn’t know about, like our other self. Patterns can tells  us about ourselves and what makes us who we are or who we wanna bee.

                 Summary:<br>
                Aaron Koblin is a data visualization artist who specialized crowd sourcing and visualization that interact with human activity and sense. His interactive video responds to human activity representing data visualization. He focuses on algorithms and data. Especially on how he could create a set of system that bring his data sets and operate them smoothly. His digital works were mostly using Processing to manage data flows. Furthermore, he collaborated with other artist to create project observing human activities, languages, and more.

                 Summary:<br>
                 Stefanie Posavec is a designer, data is her favorite material for working. Her work ranges from data visualization and information design to entrusting various clients with data art. Her personal work focuses mainly on non-traditional data representations obtained from linguistic, literary, or scientific topics, often using manual methods. She likes to manually count and calculate with her reliable mechanical pencil She works books and data, and everything in between. She mentions what is date illustrator in her speech. First, someone who represents data in order to communicate additional(subjective) messages that are not found in the data itself. Second, someone who uses data to build images where the form is as important as the data. Third, someone who uses data to arrive at design solution, where the data is not the main message. Forth, someone who uses the process of data-gathering to create meaningful visuals for a design. Fifth, someone who looks for data they can use as a lens to highlight a subject from a new angle. Furthermore, she shows her project for each point, and explain the theme of her project, for example, she translates a book into a flower project, and the leaf means the chapter she reads, and the branch means the paragraphs. She uses data create many interesting project, and she is enjoying translating books by using data.

         <h5>Nicholas Felton</h5>
             <p>Catagories:<br>
                C. Data as Portraiture
                E. Self Surveillance
                G. Creating Data Narratives
             </p>
             <p>
                 Summary:<br>
                 Nicholas Felton was a graphic designer who later became very interested in the power of number. His intention was to transform data into meaningful stories. He used himself as an experiment, marked his behavior and significant moment every single day, then calculated them after a year using processing, so the result turned out to be a visually satisfying graphical art summarizing his past year, for example: what he often ate in a day, how often he goes to the gym, how many places he traveled in the past year, how many movies have he watched, etc. It’s possible to find out his favorite restaurant, his favorite song or movie among the results. What Nicholas Felton did is he put the data into processing, then turned it into visualization. The result is made of data, but it’s more persuasive than data itself. He used this method to record his life, to tell story, and to better know himself. He truly respect the power of number.
