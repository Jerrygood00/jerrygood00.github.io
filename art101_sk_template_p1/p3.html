		<p>
		In this sketch, I also had difficult time trying to make it work normally since if and else command was confusing to me. The mouse follows the image, so as the rectangle. All rectangle changes color by moving the mouse cursor. If I press b, there will be a image and a rectangle show up in random color. I tried some new thing with importing gif in the sketch, but it did not move as the gif did. And it somehow moved in website. Thats weird I guess.

      <h5><b>Description</h5></b>
      This game that I and Winson are working on is called Adrenaline Racer. It is a 2-player game that which you can chase each others with your friends. Both players will be chasing together. Only Player1 is able to use nitrogen to speed up and arrest the race car.

      <b>p5.play: </b> there will be sprites on the cop's and race car so as the message block.
      <br>
      <b>p5.sound: </b> there will be background music while playing and in the end there will be another sound.
      <br>
      <b>p5.dom: </b> there will be a slider that control the volume of the background music and the sound effect from the cars.

      <li><b>Interface as Formal System, Language and Role-Playing Device</li></b>
      <ul>
      <li>The movement keys for player-1 will be W A D and the player-2 will be I J L. Both players will be compete with the best movement controls.</li>

      <li>The interface that put people to race in the virtual world rather than racing on the street illegally and should obey the traffic law.</li>
      </ul>



      <li><b>Simulation</li></b>
      <ul>
      <li>The game is representation and simulation of car drifting and racing in the real world. Two players will be racing on the road with bouncing blocks of messages that show traffic law and consequences</li>
      <li>In this cop chase, the race car supposed run away from the chase while messages are flying around the road.</li>
      </ul>



      <li><b>Skeumorphism vs Flat Design</li></b>
      <ul>
      <li>We will be using two 2D race car and cop car so as the message image that tells real traffice law and consequences.</li>

      <h5><b>Artist Statement</b></h5>
      <ul>
      <li>First, we did not manage to come up with an idea for the project. But I and Winson, we both agreed to create a racing game. However, when we showed it to professor Durie for feedback and it did not turned out to be successful bcause we made the prototype into a game rather than a perform of an art. So, we both had a conversation on facebook about what are we going to make the game into what professor Durie asked for. Winson suggested to put traffic laws and consequences from reality as message images so that it is not only a game but actually telling something educational to the players. We changed how the game played out and everything seemed to work fine eventually. In the end, we finished the game and performed a purpose of this game we worked on which to get the players to acknowledge the facts about drunk driving and wreckless driving, so they realized the consequences of these actions. This game is educational and it can be fun at the same time. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Interface as Formal System, Language and Role Playing device</b></h5>
      <ul>
      <li>All three interface contexts are needed to apply to the game we are working on. Since we are doing car chases refer to traffic laws and consequences, we wanted to remind players when violated those laws, cop will be after you. The messages reflect what you did and what consequences you will have. Of course, cops will be chasing you to the end of the line but why are they chasing you? The messages shall lead you to the answer. </li>
      </ul>
    
      <h5><b>Group Project Documentation</h5></b>

      <ul>
      <li>For project 3, I and Winson Cheung decided to work together on it. My role of this project was to find and import soundtracks and create sliders that controls maximum volume of the sound. Also to create sprites of message images that Winson researched and gave me to flow around the canvas when car sprites hit. First, I grabbed some interesting soundstracks that I already had on my desktop and type preload to load sound and then add looping to them so that the background music keeps playing. After we both talked to professor Durie, I begen working on message sprites. I put two different global integers (var message#Image and message#). One is for the loading image and the other one is for sprites function. Once the images were loaded and the spirtes was in position, I added the bounce to car which applied to the message images so that when the car hits, both car and the message image will bounce to different direction. Later on I added two global integers for sliders. I adjusted the position of it so that when people open their browser, the slider will be on the correct position. According to p5.sound.js, I added a local integer on function draw as a volume control. The slider.value changes the amp of sound so that when people dragged the circle on the slider, the volume changes. In the end, we both added the code for the ending image to pop out the sound when two cars hit together. Overall, I and Winson had problem on deciding which idea we were going to use, but it was solved quickly. Another problem for me was to add sound effect on the car. For example, if the car turns, a sound should play. But it creates a massive sound overlay when pressed the key too many times. So I added song to loop instead. We both discussed the work through facebook and not much problem was encountered. </li>
